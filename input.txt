Project Name: Quick_Test
    project name, used for output files

Lattice Type: 0
    defines the mode the lattice simulation is running in 
    (0: simple simulation, 1: iterative Boltzmann procedure, 2: determination of CHOL's effect on entropy)
Interaction Type: 0
    defines the interaction type used 
    (0: avg order parameter, 1: minimal order parameter)
Movement Type: 1
    defines the movement type used 
    (0: random jumps, 1: jumps to adjacent lattice sites)

Dimension: 2
    dimension of the lattice (should be 2 in most cases)
Lattice Size: 10
    defines the number of sites in every dimension

Temperature: 330
    temperature in K
Number of Lipids: 1
    number of different lipid types
Lipid Type: 0
    type of lipid for simulations with one lipid (0: DPPC, 1: DLiPC)
Concentration (DLiPC): 0.5
    concentration of DLiPC in simulations with 2 lipid types (DPPC and DLiPC)
Concentration (CHOL): 0.0
    concentration of CHOL (the maximal concentration is 0.5)
Orderwidth: 11
    defines the change of the order parameter

Number of Runs: 0
    number of additional runs after the first
Number of Steps: 500000
    number of MC steps per run
Data Points: 25
    number of steps counted for the calculation of output parameters
Equilibrium: 0.75
    percentage after which the output parameters are calculated
